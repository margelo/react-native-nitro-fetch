**react-native-nitro-fetch** is a general purpose network fetching library for React Native. It can be used as a drop-in replacement for the built-in `fetch(...)` method, as well as provide additional features like prefetching and workletized mappers.

## Features

- üîß Drop-in replacement for the built-in `fetch(...)` method
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Fast HTTP stack using [Cronet](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/lkgr/components/cronet/README.md) on Android, and [URLSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/URLSession) on iOS
- üí™ Supports HTTP/1, HTTP/2 and [HTTP/3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/3) over [QUIC](https://www.chromium.org/quic/), [Brotli](https://github.com/google/brotli), and disk cache
- ‚è∞ Prefetching on app-startup for even faster initialization
- üßµ Worklet support for parallel data mapping without blocking the JS Thread
- üî• Powered by [Nitro Modules](https://github.com/mrousavy/nitro)

## Installation

```sh
npm i react-native-nitro-fetch react-native-nitro-modules
```

> [Nitro Modules](https://github.com/mrousavy/nitro) requires react-native 0.75+ or higher

## Usage

To simply fetch data, import the `fetch(...)` method from `react-native-nitro-fetch`:

```ts
import { fetch } from 'react-native-nitro-fetch';

const res = await fetch('https://httpbin.org/get');
const json = await res.json();
```

This can be used as a drop-in-replacement for the built-in `fetch(...)` method.

### Prefetching in JS

You can prefetch a URL in JS, which keeps the result cached for the next actual `fetch(...)` call - this can be used shortly before navigating to a new screen to have results hot & ready:

```ts
import { prefetch } from 'react-native-nitro-fetch';

await prefetch('https://httpbin.org/uuid', {
  headers: { prefetchKey: 'uuid' },
});
```

Then, on the new screen that was navigated to:

```ts
import { fetch } from 'react-native-nitro-fetch';

const res = await fetch('https://httpbin.org/uuid', {
  headers: { prefetchKey: 'uuid' },
});
console.log('prefetched header:', res.headers.get('nitroPrefetched'));
```

### Prefetching for the next app launch

Prefetching data on app launch (or _process start_) will make it hot & ready once your JS code actually runs. Call `prefetchOnAppStart(...)` to enqueue a prefetch for the **next** app start:

```ts
import { prefetchOnAppStart } from 'react-native-nitro-fetch';

await prefetchOnAppStart('https://httpbin.org/uuid', {
  prefetchKey: 'uuid',
});
```

Then, once the app opens the next time, a call to `fetch(...)` might resolve faster since it will contain already cached results:

```ts
import { fetch } from 'react-native-nitro-fetch';

const res = await fetch('https://httpbin.org/uuid', {
  headers: { prefetchKey: 'uuid' },
});
console.log('prefetched header:', res.headers.get('nitroPrefetched'));
```

In our tests, prefetching alone yielded a **~220 ms** faster TTI (time-to-interactive) time! ü§Ø

### Worklet Mapping

Since Nitro Fetch is a [Nitro Module](https://nitro.margelo.com), it can be used from Worklets.
This can be useful to parse data without blocking the main JS-Thread:

```ts
import { nitroFetchOnWorklet } from 'react-native-nitro-fetch';

const data = await nitroFetchOnWorklet(
  'https://httpbin.org/get',
  undefined,
  (payload) => {
    'worklet';
    return JSON.parse(payload.bodyString ?? '{}');
  }
);
```

## Project Status

Nitro Fetch is currently in an alpha stage. You can adopt it in production, but keep in mind that the library and it's API is subject to change.

## Limitations & Alternatives

- [HTTP streaming](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API) is not yet supported. As an alternative, use Expo's [expo-fetch](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/expo/). Streaming is on the roadmap.
- [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket) are not supported. For high‚Äëperformance sockets and binary streams, consider using [react-native-fast-io](https://github.com/callstackincubator/react-native-fast-io) by our friends at Callstack.

## Configuration

You can configure `react-native-nitro-fetch` by adding a `react-native-nitro-fetch` section to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "react-native-nitro-fetch": {
    "httpCache": true,
    "httpCacheSizeMB": 50,
    "httpCacheMemoryMB": 32,
    "enableHttp2": true,
    "enableQuic": true,
    "enableBrotli": true,
    "userAgent": "MyApp/1.0",
    "storagePath": "nitro_cronet_cache"
  }
}
```
